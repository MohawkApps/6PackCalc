![App Icon](resources/Icon-120.png)

#### A [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) application brought to you by [Mohawk Apps](http://www.mohawkapps.com/).

Ever wonder how much you’re really paying for that pint of beer? Or how much that 64oz growler actually costs without having to do conversions in your head? 

With Six-Pack Equivalent Calculator, you put in the cost of your beer and the amount you got and the app will tell you the cost if you bought a six-pack of that particular beer. 

The idea is that everyone knows how much a six-pack of their favorite beer costs. This converter will help you determine the price of what you’re drinking right now to an equivalent you are already familiar with! 

I was happy to realize that a $9 fill of my 1/2 gallon growler (64oz) at my local brewpub was the equivalent of a $10.12 six-pack! That’s a great deal for craft beer when I’m used to paying upwards of $12 or more for good craft beer.
